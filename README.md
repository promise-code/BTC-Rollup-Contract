# Bitcoin Rollup System Smart Contract

## Overview

This smart contract implements a sophisticated Bitcoin rollup system designed to enable efficient and scalable transaction processing on the Stacks blockchain. The contract provides a robust mechanism for managing Bitcoin-related transactions through a layer-2 scaling solution, including deposit, batching, verification, and withdrawal functionalities.

## Features

### Key Capabilities

- User deposits and fund management
- Transaction batching
- Merkle proof verification
- Secure withdrawal mechanisms
- Operator-controlled batch submission and verification

### Security Mechanisms

- Multiple validation checks
- Prevention of integer overflow
- Transaction hash verification
- Operator authorization controls
- Minimum deposit and maximum transaction limits

## Contract Components

### Constants

- Error codes for various failure scenarios
- Predefined system limits and constraints

### State Variables

- Current batch ID tracking
- Operator management
- Batch size configuration
- Minimum deposit requirements
- State root management

### Key Maps

- `user-balances`: Tracks individual user fund balances
- `processed-tx-hashes`: Prevents duplicate transaction processing
- `pending-deposits`: Manages unconfirmed user deposits
- `batches`: Stores batch-related metadata
- `transaction-proofs`: Maintains transaction verification information

## Core Functions

### Deposit Workflow

- `deposit(tx-hash, amount)`: Initiates a deposit with transaction hash validation
- `confirm-deposit(tx-hash)`: Finalizes and credits user deposits

### Batch Management

- `submit-batch(transactions, merkle-root)`: Allows operators to submit transaction batches
- `verify-batch(batch-id, proof)`: Enables batch verification by authorized operators

### Withdrawal

- `withdraw(amount, proof)`: Permits users to withdraw funds using Merkle proofs

### Utility Functions

- Merkle proof verification
- Transaction hash generation
- Operator management

## Security Considerations

- Strict operator authentication
- Prevention of zero-value transactions
- Comprehensive error handling
- Merkle root verification
- Transaction hash uniqueness checks

## Usage Example

```clarity
;; Deposit funds
(contract-call? .btc-rollup-system
    deposit
    0x1234... ;; Transaction hash
    u1000000) ;; Amount in satoshis

;; Confirm deposit
(contract-call? .btc-rollup-system
    confirm-deposit
    0x1234...) ;; Transaction hash

;; Withdraw funds
(contract-call? .btc-rollup-system
    withdraw
    u500000 ;; Amount
    proof-list) ;; Merkle proof
```

## Limitations and Constraints

- Maximum batch size: 100 transactions
- Minimum deposit: 1,000,000 satoshis
- Operator-controlled batch submission
- Requires Merkle proof for withdrawals

## Error Handling

The contract defines multiple error codes to provide precise feedback:

- `ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED`: Unauthorized operation attempt
- `ERR-INVALID-BATCH`: Invalid batch submission
- `ERR-INVALID-PROOF`: Merkle proof verification failure
- `ERR-INSUFFICIENT-FUNDS`: Insufficient user balance
- And several other specific error scenarios

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient Merkle root computation
- Constant-time validation checks
- Minimal storage overhead
- Optimized transaction processing

## Potential Improvements

1. Enhanced operator whitelisting
2. More granular access control
3. Additional withdrawal verification mechanisms
4. Gas optimization techniques

## Dependencies

- Stacks blockchain
- Clarity smart contract language
- Merkle tree implementation
